                  Climate change science has witnessed an explosion in the
                  amount and types of data that can be brought to bear on the
                  potential responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle and
                  biodiversity to global change. Many of the most pressing
                  questions about global change are not necessarily limited by
                  the need to collect new data as much as by our ability to
                  synthesize existing data. This project specifically seeks to
                  improve this ability.

                  Because no one measurement provides a complete picture,
                  multiple data sources must be integrated in a sensible manner.
                  Process-based models represent an ideal framework for
                  integrating these data streams because they represent multiple
                  processes at different spatial and temporal scales in ways
                  that capture our current understanding of the causal
                  connections across scales and among data types.
